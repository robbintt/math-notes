# Math Notes

How can I store math notes as code?

## Is this form of expression useful for initial problem solving?

If I put the problem in and get the solution, then I've ruined the problem. I should solve it first from my available context (e.g. book, lectures, similar problems in the set or previous sets).

*However, once I've solved it, it's worth it to explore the intermediate space with solvers.*

## Working through problems

I am not sure the best way to work through a problem as code.

I do know that problem solving mimics generating a mathematical proof.

Many proofs exist for a particular math concept, so working through problems is about taking the path relevant to the context you are working within. 

### On Solutions

Perhaps the most bizarre part of math is the concept of "solving a problem".

Math conjectures are solved when expressed as a proof in "existing math".

Often, high profile conjectures are solved by inventing a new "mathematical concept" or "form of mathematical expression".


### Typical Problem Solving

Typical algorithm for doing math problem: Given a problem and some math context, find a solution.

#### Definitions & Expressions

- Problem: expressed by a set of math notations.
- Context: expressed as a collection of lectures, english writing, and math notations.
- Solution: Acceptable transformation of the problem with the provided context.

### TDD: Test Driven Development

Once I have a problem and a solution, I can simply express the intermediate steps and expect to arrive at the same solution.

Given a math problem and solution, I can build a manifold of steps that get there.

Typically humans consider "showing your work" to be a sufficiently short path from the problem to the solution.

Most problem-solution pairs are intended to cross a set of `critical facts` that cannot be bypassed anyways.

Still, it's interesting to think of isomorphic problem spaces and transformations as this repo grows.
